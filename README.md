# üíª Laptop Price Predictor - Machine Learning Project

A machine learning project developed during the **NTI program**, focused on predicting laptop prices based on specifications.  
This project demonstrates the **complete ML workflow**: exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

## üìå Overview
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset:
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values  
  - Visualization of categorical and numerical features  
  - Correlation analysis between specs and price  
- Applied **data preprocessing** and handeled outliers  
- Engineered features to improve model performance  
- Trained and tested regression models for price prediction  
- Evaluated models using metrics such as **R¬≤, MSE, and MAE**
