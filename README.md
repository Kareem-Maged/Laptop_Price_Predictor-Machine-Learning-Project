# üíª Laptop Price Predictor - Machine Learning Project

A machine learning project developed during the **NTI training**, focused on predicting laptop prices based on specifications.  
This project showcases the end-to-end machine learning workflow ‚Äî starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by data preprocessing and feature engineering, and culminating in model training, testing, and performance evaluation ‚Äî all with the goal of achieving the best possible prediction accuracy, with plans for future improvements and extensions.

## üìå Overview
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset:
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values  
  - Visualization of categorical and numerical features  
  - Correlation analysis between specs and price  
- Applied **data preprocessing** and handeled outliers  
- Engineered features to improve model performance  
- Trained and tested regression models for price prediction  
- Evaluated models using metrics such as **R¬≤, MSE, and MAE**
