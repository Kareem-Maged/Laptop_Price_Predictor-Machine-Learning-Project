## 📌 Overview
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset:
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values  
  - Visualization of categorical and numerical features  
  - Correlation analysis between specs and price  
- Applied **data preprocessing** with One-Hot Encoding and feature scaling  
- Engineered features to improve model performance  
- Trained and tested regression models for price prediction  
- Evaluated models using metrics such as **R², MSE, and MAE**
